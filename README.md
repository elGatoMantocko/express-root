# Base Express App

This branch provides an architecture that is a base express app with a straightforward mvp pattern. All pages are rendered server side with handlebars and each page has it's own template in the `views/app/templates` directory. Template names are the then the name of the page path.

## Development and Test

Start your app with `npm run watch` and build your assets with `npx gulp build`. Watch your assets with `npx gulp watch`.
